## 👋 About Me

I am a data professional operating at the intersection of Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning. My approach bridges the gap between academic rigour (MSc from Birkbeck, University of London) and over a decade of commercial project management experience.

I specialise in building robust and interpretable predictive models, with a particular focus on Credit Risk, Statistical Learning, and ESG-driven analytics. I thrive in environments that require both high-level strategic thinking and granular data engineering.
