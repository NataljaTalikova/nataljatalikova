## 👋 About Me

I'm transitioning back into professional life with a background in project management and a current focus on quantitative finance and data science—with an ESG twist.  

Pursuing an MSc in Quantitative Finance with Data Science at Birkbeck, I blend academic rigor with cross-sector experience and real-world adaptability. I'm keen to contribute analytical, technical, and strategic insights in collaborative, research-driven environments.
